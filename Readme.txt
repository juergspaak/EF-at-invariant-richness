This repository contains all the code used for the simulations in the paper ***

To understand the code within the program it is strongly suggested to
read the paper as well as the Supplementary Info.

The code on master branch is fully vectoriced, it can be helpfull to have a look at the branch 
"simple_version" to understand the code. The branch "simple_version" is non vectorized but easier
to understand. Espceially the community_construction* files.

The files are:
community_construction_coex.py:
Contains all functions for the invariant community structure case
community_construction_repl.py:
Contains all functions for the variant community structure case
The files community_construction* contain the same function names,
the functions with the same name do the same, one with invariant com. structure
and the other with changing community structure.

parameters_construction.py
Is run automatically, the first time you run community_construction_repl.py
or some of the plot_fig* files. It creates the pickle file "repl, com_para.p".

repl, com_para.p:
Pickle file that contains 10*100'000 communities. Five with positive 
environmental change and Five with negative. Community structure changes,
2 for each of the cases: p=0.95, p=0.75, p=0.50, p=0.25, p = 0.05.
This file is not in the github repository, it will be automatically generated by
the files, when it is needed. Creating this file can take some few mintues.

percentiles.py:
Contains plot functions that are used by the plot_fig* files. 

plot_fig*:
Generates the figure(s) indicated. Correspond to the "Figure *,pdf" files

comp_table_S3_S5.py
Computes the tables S3 and S5

Examples.txt:
Contains a list of simple examples. Complicated examples can be found in the
plot_fig* files and parameters_construction.py
