This branch contains a non vectorized version of the rand_par and coex_test functions.
These functions are equivalent to the vectorized version, but more easy to understand.

The function rand:par generates ONE community and checks, whether thsi community fullfills
the coexistence requirements. It continues constructing communities until it fnds one
fullfilling the requirements.
