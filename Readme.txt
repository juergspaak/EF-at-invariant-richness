This repository contains all the code used for the simulations in the paper ***

To understand the code within the program it is strongly suggested to
read the paper as well as the Supplementary Info.

The code found in the master branch is a faster(~x100) version of the original code used for the paper
The original code can be found in the branch Orig_paper
The code in the master branch is a vectoriced form of the original code, it is equivalent but the
community_construction* functions are more complicated. It can be helpful to switch to the Orig_paper
branch to understand the code.

The files are:
community_construction_coex.py:
Contains all functions for the invariant community structure case
community_construction_repl.py:
Contains all functions for the variant community structure case
The files community_construction* contain the same function names,
the functions with the same name do the same, one with invariant com. structure
and the other with changing community structure.

parameters_construction.py
Is run automatically, the first time you run community_construction_repl.py
or some of the plot_fig* files. It creates the pickle file "repl, com_para.p".

repl, com_para.p:
Pickle file that contains 4*2*100'000 communities. Four with positive 
environmental change and four with negative. Community structure changes,
2 for each of the cases: p=0.95, p=0.50, p is random, p = 0.05.
This file is not in the github repository, it will be automatically generated by
the files, when it is needed. Creating this file can take some few mintues.

percentiles.py:
Contains a plot function that is used by the plot_fig* files. 

plot_fig*:
Generates the figure(s) indicated. Correspond to the "Figure *,pdf" files

comp_table_S3_S5.py
Computes the tables S3 and S5

Examples.txt:
Contains a list of simple examples. Complicated examples can be found in the
plot_fig* files and parameters_construction.py
